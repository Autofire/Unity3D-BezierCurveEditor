This page covers how to use the Bezier Curve tool in Unity. This does not discuss how to get code working with the curve or make the curve do anything; it only discusses some of the minutia of using the tool in the Scene view and the Inspector.

<h1>Creating a Curve</h1>
There are two options for getting a curve into the scene:
<ul>
<li>Starting from the Toolbar, `GameObject -> Create Other -> Bezier Curve`. If you'd rather use the Hierarchy, you can also use `Create -> Create Other -> Bezier Curve`. This will create a new GameObject and attach a simple circle using a Bezier Curve. This is great if you want a nice example.
<li>If you'd rather use an existing object, you can add a the `BezierCurve` component a GameObject. This will create an empty curve without any points.
</ul>

WIP.
