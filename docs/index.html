Welcome to the Unity3D-BezierCurveEditor wiki!

This is a component for BezierCurves in Unity space. Note that this is tool for programmers to use to make custom editors, and it does nothing out of the box.

This is based upon <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11278">Arkham Interactive's Bezier Curve Editor</a>. Most of the enhancements have to do simplifying the original code (to use Lists instead of Arrays) and making the custom editor play nice with Unity 2017. Furthermore, it's a little more extendable.
